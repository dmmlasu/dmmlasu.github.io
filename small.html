<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- <p>Social media  greatly enable people to participate in online activities. A typical  social networking site allows users to specify only positive links to  other users such as friendships. Little attention  is paid to ``negative links" which are implicit links among social  users that indicate distrust, dislike, or antagonism. This project  studies fundamental data analytics issues of understanding and  identifying negative social network links. This project explores  new research endeavors to mine actionable and insightful patterns in <em>computer science</em> and to enable the large-scale study of social  media user behaviors in <em>computational social science</em>.  The research insights gained through this project should benefit the  design  of new recommender systems and lead to better design of supervised and  unsupervised learning algorithms on networks with both positive and  negative links. The study of negative social network links can have  impact on industrial IT applications by improving  services and user experience. The proposed research will involve  graduate and undergraduate students in pursuing their theses or projects. Research topics and findings will be integrated in undergraduate and graduate education. The research discovery made through this project will be shared at this project site. </p>
<p> Networks in social media are  large-scale, incomplete, and noisy. As negative links between users are  often invisible on social networking sites, discovering them entails  novel challenges. The research team proposes  to evaluate the value of negative links for better social network  understanding and link discovery. They propose a group of data analytics  techniques, including positive and unlabeled learning, learning with  cross-media data, to efficiently predict negative  links. The team also proposes to apply the research insights for the  better design of recommendation systems, social user classification, and  social user clustering. The research team plans to share benchmark data  with the research community to promote the  research on negative link discovery on social networks.</p> -->
